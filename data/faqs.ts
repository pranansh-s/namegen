		 •	Simplicity: A brandable business name is easy to spell and pronounce. If customers struggle with your name, it can create barriers to word-of-mouth marketing and online searches. 
		 •	Relevance: While not always explicitly descriptive of the business, a brandable name often has an inherent link or connotation to the industry, product, or service offered. It should provide a hint about what your business does. 
		 •	Positivity: A brandable name generally evokes a positive emotional response, avoiding negative connotations or language that might be considered offensive or distasteful. 
		 •	Flexibility: The name can adapt as the business grows or diversifies, rather than being too narrowly focused on a specific product, location, or market. 
		 •	Domain Availability: In the digital age, a brandable name usually needs a corresponding available domain name, ideally a .com, which is still perceived as the most professional and credible. 
		 •	Legally Protectable: Ideally, the name can be trademarked, providing exclusive rights to use the name and protect it from use by competitors.`,
